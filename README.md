# Insertion sort
The insertion sort algorithm is works by taking in an unsorted list, and sets a variable
to the length of the list.

it then iterates over the list using the index length setting a value variable to the 
item at index i of the list

a while loop then checks if the item to the left of the value in the list is greater than
the value variable and not zero.

If True, we reasign the positions of these list elements within the list.
and set our i to equal i-1.

we then return the list.
